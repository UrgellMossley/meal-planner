# meal-planner
A basic Meal Ordering app which allowed me to develop my CSS skills and some basic OOP skills.

I wanted to make an app that helped me demostrate a few things:

- Responsive web design with a mobile first ethos
- Nav elements that are unobtusive and effective
- OOP proficiency, using protypical inheritance to render DOM elements
- Local Storage usage, being able to create and destroy persistent data, and this data affecting DOM elements

As of first commit, there are many things to work upon:

- Local Storage issue, if arr.length > 0, then items aren't getting pushed in
- General UI optimisation, and dummy text insertion
- Menu page
- Suggestion Page revamp, and CSS upgrades
- General Code Review and clean up
